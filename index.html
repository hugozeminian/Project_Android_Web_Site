            <h1>Android Mascot History</h1>

            <p>You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most used for mobile devices in the world. But maybe you don't know that your friendly pet has a name and a very curious history? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>

            <h2>The first version</h2>

            <p>The first attempt at creating a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="extern">Dan Morrill</a>. He says that he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank" class="extern">Inkscape</a> (free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was just to personify the system just for his team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

            </picture>

            <p>This first bizarre version was even named in honor of its creator: the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>

            <h2>A new mascot appears</h2>

            <p>The idea of ​​having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the area. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/android" target="_blank" class="extern">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was given the mission to represent the little robot in a more pleasant way.</p>

            <img src="img/irina-blok.jpg" alt="Irina Blok">

            <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The drawing should also generate quick identification with the viewer. Then came the <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, the new mascot of Android.</p>

            <img src="img/bugdroid.png" alt="Bugdroid" class="small">

            <p>The main inspiration for the features of the new <strong>Bugdroid</strong> came from those little dolls that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating on her desk at <strong>Google</strong>'s office and looked towards the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.</p>

                <h3>Want to learn more?</h3>

                <p>Another curious thing about Android is that each version has always been named after a candy, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><abbr title="Bolo de copo">1.5 - Cupcake</abbr></li>
                    <li><abbr title="Donut">1.6 - Donut</abbr></li>
                    <li><abbr title="Bomba">3.0 - Eclair</abbr></li>
                    <li><abbr title="Iogurte Congelado">2.2 - Froyo</abbr></li>
                    <li><abbr title="Biscoito de Gengibre">2.3 - Gingerbread</abbr></li>
                    <li><abbr title="Favo de Mel">3.0 - Honeycomb</abbr></li>
                    <li><abbr title="Sanduíche de Sorvete">4.0 - Ice Cream Sandwich</abbr></li>
                    <li><abbr title="Jujuba">4.1 - Jelly Bean</abbr></li>
                    <li><abbr title="KitKat">4.4 - KitKat</abbr></li>
                    <li><abbr title="Pirulito">5.0 - Lolipop</abbr></li>
                    <li><abbr title="Marshmallow">6.0 - Marshmallow</abbr></li>
                    <li><abbr title="Torrone">7.0 - Nougat</abbr>/li>
                    <li><abbr title="Oreo">8.0 - Oreo</abbr></li>
                    <li><abbr title="Torta">9.0 - Pie</abbr></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Unfortunately, <strong>Android Q</strong> did not exist, as Google decided to put an end to this fun practice and started using numbers, which gave rise to <strong>Android 10</strong>.</p>
